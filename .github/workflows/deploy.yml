name: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Emergency Only)

# IMPORTANT: This workflow is for EMERGENCY manual deployments only
# Normal deployments happen automatically as part of the release workflow
# which ensures backend changes are coordinated with frontend deployments.
#
# Use this workflow ONLY when:
# - You need to deploy a hotfix outside the normal release cycle
# - The release workflow is broken and you need to deploy immediately
#
# Before running this workflow manually, ensure:
# 1. The backend API is deployed and ready
# 2. API_URL secret is configured in GitHub repository settings
#    OR NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is updated in the build step below
