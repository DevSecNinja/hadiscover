# HA Discover

**HA Discover** is a search engine for Home Assistant automations hosted on GitHub. It allows you to discover, explore, and learn from automations created by the Home Assistant community.

## What is HA Discover?

HA Discover indexes Home Assistant automation files from GitHub repositories that opt in by adding the `ha-discover` topic to their repository. It provides a simple, searchable interface to find automations by name, description, trigger types, or related repositories.

Think of it as a specialized search engine for Home Assistant configurations—similar to how kubesearch.dev works for Kubernetes resources, but focused specifically on Home Assistant automations.

## Why HA Discover?

Home Assistant users often create sophisticated automations and share them on GitHub, but discovering these automations can be challenging. HA Discover solves this by:

- **Centralizing Discovery**: Aggregating automations from multiple repositories into one searchable index
- **Facilitating Learning**: Helping users learn from real-world automation examples
- **Promoting Sharing**: Encouraging the community to share their automations by making them easily discoverable
- **Opt-in Design**: Respecting privacy by only indexing repositories that explicitly opt in

## Features

- 🔍 **Full-text Search**: Search automations by name, description, trigger types, and repository information
- 📊 **Statistics Dashboard**: View total repositories and automations indexed
- 🔄 **On-demand Indexing**: Trigger re-indexing to discover newly added repositories
- 🔗 **Direct GitHub Links**: Every automation links directly to its source on GitHub
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- ⚡ **Fast API**: RESTful API powered by FastAPI for quick searches

## How It Works

1. **Repository Discovery**: HA Discover searches GitHub for repositories with the `ha-discover` topic
2. **Automation Extraction**: For each repository, it locates automation files (e.g., `automations.yaml`)
3. **Parsing**: Automations are parsed using best-effort YAML parsing to extract metadata
4. **Indexing**: Automations are stored in a SQLite database with full-text search capability
5. **Search Interface**: Users can search through the indexed automations via a web UI

## Getting Started

### Adding Your Repository

To have your Home Assistant configuration indexed:

1. Ensure your repository contains automation files (e.g., `automations.yaml`)
2. Add the `ha-discover` topic to your GitHub repository:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click the ⚙️ icon next to "About"
   - Add `ha-discover` to the topics list
   - Save changes
3. Trigger indexing on HA Discover (or wait for the next scheduled index)

## Develop a new feature

### Prerequisites

- **Backend**: Python 3.12+, pip
- **Frontend**: Node.js 18+, npm
- **Optional**: GitHub Personal Access Token (for higher API rate limits)

### Running Locally

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevSecNinja/ha-discover.git
cd ha-discover
```

#### 2. Set Up the Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add your GITHUB_TOKEN if desired

# Run the backend server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

#### 3. Set Up the Frontend

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# (Optional) Configure environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The web UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

#### 4. Trigger Indexing

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click the "Trigger Re-Index" button to start discovering repositories
3. Wait a few moments, then refresh to see the results

## API Documentation

The backend API is documented with OpenAPI/Swagger. Once the backend is running, visit:

- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **ReDoc**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Key Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/search?q={query}` - Search for automations
- `GET /api/v1/statistics` - Get indexing statistics
- `POST /api/v1/index` - Trigger repository indexing (rate limited to once per 10 minutes)
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Health check

## Testing

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/ -v
```

All tests should pass. The test suite includes:

- YAML parsing tests
- Search functionality tests
- API endpoint tests

## Architecture

For detailed information about the system architecture, data flow, and design decisions, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment (GitHub Pages)

The frontend is deployed to GitHub Pages for free static hosting. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

**Current deployment**: `https://devsecninja.github.io/ha-discover/`

### Backend Deployment (Required)

⚠️ **Important**: The backend API must be deployed separately since GitHub Pages only hosts static files.

See **[BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT.md](./BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT.md)** for comprehensive deployment instructions.

**Quick start options:**
- **[Railway](https://railway.app/)** - Recommended, free tier, auto-deploys from GitHub
- **[Render](https://render.com/)** - Free tier, simple configuration
- **[Heroku](https://heroku.com/)** - Established platform with free tier

**Setup steps:**

1. **Deploy backend** using one of the platforms above (includes config files)
2. **Get your backend URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
3. **Configure frontend**:
   - **Option A**: Add GitHub Secret named `API_URL` with your backend URL
   - **Option B**: Edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
4. **Deploy frontend**: Push to `main` branch to trigger GitHub Actions deployment
5. **Access your site**: `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`

The deployment workflow automatically runs all backend tests before deploying to ensure code quality.

**Configuration files included:**
- `backend/railway.toml` - Railway deployment
- `backend/render.yaml` - Render deployment
- `backend/Procfile` - Heroku deployment
- `backend/runtime.txt` - Python version

For detailed step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting, and advanced options, see **[BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT.md](./BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT.md)**.
